# Automatic-Water-Level-Controller-Using-Arduino
The Automatic Water Level Controller is an Arduino-based system that automatically regulates the water level in tanks or reservoirs. It uses sensors such as float switches, conductive probes, or ultrasonic sensors to continuously monitor the water level. The Arduino processes the sensor input and controls the water pump through a relay module.
